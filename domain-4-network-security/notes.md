# DOMAIN 4: Network Security

## 📖 Overview
> Sections in this domain:

1. Computer Networking
2. Network Threats and Attacks
3. Network Security Infrastructure

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- Firewalls, Routers, Switches
- Threat Types
- Networks (OSI model, TCP/IP, IPv4, IPv6, Wi-Fi)
- Ports and Applications
- IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
- VPNs and Secure Protocols
- Network Segmentation and DMZ
- IP Addressing and Subnetting Basics
- Cloud

## 📌 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | Monitors for malicious activity |
| Virtual Private Network (VPN) | Creates an encrypted tunnel between networks or devices |
| Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) | A buffer zone between internal and external networks |

---

## 🧠 Exam Tips

- 🔸 Understand **OSI vs TCP/IP models**
- 🔸 Know which **protocols are secure vs insecure** (e.g. HTTPS vs HTTP)
- 🔸 Recognize common **network threats** like MITM or DDoS

---

## 📝 Notes

- Draw a sample secure network topology
- Protocols cheat sheet (FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, etc.)
