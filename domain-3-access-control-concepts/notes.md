| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Discretionary Access Control (DAC) | Owner controls access |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Based on user's role |
| Mandatory Access Control (MAC) | Access control model where permissions are enforced by a central authority |
| Multifactor Authentication (MFA) | Requires two or more factors: something you know, have, are |
| Principle of Least Privilege | Users/systems are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks |
| Segregation of Duties (SoD) | Dividing of critical tasks among multiple users to prevent fraud, errors, and unauthorised actions |
| Physical Security | Protection of physical assets |

### Principle of Least Privilege

The purpose of this concept is to limit potential damage from accidental OR malicious actions.

### Segregation of Duties

The purpose is to ensure no individual has complete control over any sensitive operations which can reduce insider threats.

### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

This provides a flexible access control model in wchih the **owner** of a resource is the one who determines who can access it and what actions they are able to perform.

### Physical Security

There are many key components involved with physical security, they are as follows:

- **Access Control:** Implementing measures to restrict access to authorised personnel only.
- **Perimeter Security:** Protection of the physical boundaries of a facility.
- **Environmental Controls:** Maintains optimal environmental conditions are hardware and data. For example, climate control, fire suppression systems and power backup solutions.

#### Access Badges

- Verify the identity of any individuals entering secured areas.
- Configurable to allow entry to specific zones based on an individuals roles and permissions.
- Badge usage can be logged and monitored to help with incident investigation.
- Can be integrated with PINs / biometrics.
- Works as a visible reminder of an organisations security protocols.
- Can easily be deactivated if a badge is lost or stolen.

#### Video Surveillance

- Provide a way to monitor and record a property perimeter.
- These are considered **detective** physical controls. However, their presence can also be a **deterrent**.
