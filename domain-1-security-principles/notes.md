## 📌 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CIA Triad | Model for securing data: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability |
| Least Privilege | Users are given the minimum levels of access needed |
| Multifactor Authentication (MFA) | Requires users to provide 2 or more forms of identification to gain access |
| Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) | Legal agreement to ensure confidential information isn't shared |
| Non-Repudiation | Ensures a person or system cannot deny actions they have performed |
| AAA | Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting |
| Exposure Factor (EF) | Percentage of an asset's value that is lost due to a specific risk event |
| Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) | Expected financial loss from a single risk event |
| Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO) | Estimated numbre of times a specific risk it expected to occur in a year |
| Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE) | Projected annual financial loss from a specific risk |
| Policies | High-level statements which define an organisations approach to security |
| Standards | Mandatory and detailed rules which specify consistent methods, criteria or specifications to ensure implementation of policies across an organisation |

## 🧠 Exam Tips

- 🔸 Know the difference between **confidentiality vs. integrity**
- 🔸 Understand **risk vs. threat vs. vulnerability**

### Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA Triad) 

### Non-Repudiation

- Ensures a person or system cannot deny actions which they have performed. E.g. sending a message or signing a document.
- Uses methods such as digital signatures and logs as proof of these actions.
- Non-repudiation helps to build trust and accountability.
- It holds people responsible for their actions.

#### Examples: 

1. Digital signatures
2. Audit logs
3. Biometric access
4. Payment confirmations

### AAA - Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting

#### Authentication 

- Process of verifying the identity of user, device, or system to ensure only authorised entities gain access to resources.
- E.g. validating credentials such as passwords, biometrics and security tokens.

#### Authorisation

- Determining and granting a user's permission to access specific resources, actions, or use services based on the identity.
- Tends to take place AFTER authentication.

#### Accounting

- Refers to tracking and recording a user's activities.
- E.g. access to resources, performed actions, and system usage.

### Multifactor Authentication

Requires at least 2 or more factors for authorisation:

- SOMETHING YOU KNOW. Such as; passwords, PINs and security questions.
- SOMETHING YOU HAVE. Such as; smartphones, smart cards and tokens.
- SOMETHING YOU ARE. Such as; fingerprints, facial features andiris patterns.
- SOMEWHERE YOU ARE. Such as; IP address, GPS and Wi-Fi location.

### Risk Reporting

- Documenting and communicating risk-related information to stakeholders.
- Has details of identified risks, their status, mitigation efforts and the potential impacts.
- Helps stakeholders make informed decisions so resources can be prioritised for risk management.

### Security Controls

| Categories | Types |
|------------|-------|
| Technical | Preventive |
| Managerial | Deterrent|
| Operational | Detective |
| Physical | Corrective |
| | Compensating |
| | Directive |

#### Categories

- __Techinal Controls__ include hardware or software used to manage access to resources and systems whilst providing protection for those resources and systems.
- __Managerial Controls__ are policies and procedures defined by an organisations security policy.
- __Operational Controls__ ensure day-to-day operations comply with overall security.
- __Physical Controls__ are mechanisms focused on providing protection to the facility and real-world objects.

#### Types

- __Deterrent__ controls are deployed to discourage an attack
- __Preventive__ controls are used to prevent/stop unwanted/unauthorised activity
- __Detective__ controls discover/detect any unwanted or unauthorised activity
- __Compensating__ controls give options to other controls which can help in enforcing security policies
- __Corrective__ controls are the measures taken to fix security vulnerabilities or mitigate damage after an incident
- __Directive__ controls are measures designed to guide behaviour and enforce compliance of security policies and procedures

### ISC2 Code of Ethics

__Purpose__: a set of principles which guide cybersecurity professionals in maintaining integrity, professionalism, and responsibility when protecting the public, organisations and the profession.
