### Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA Triad) 

### Non-Repudiation

- Ensures a person or system cannot deny actions which they have performed. E.g. sending a message or signing a document.
- Uses methods such as digital signatures and logs as proof of these actions.
- Non-repudiation helps to build trust and accountability.
- It holds people responsible for their actions.

#### Examples: 

1. Digital signatures
2. Audit logs
3. Biometric access
4. Payment confirmations

### AAA - Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting

#### Authentication 

- Process of verifying the identity of user, device, or system to ensure only authorised entities gain access to resources.
- E.g. validating credentials such as passwords, biometrics and security tokens.

#### Authorisation

- Determining and granting a user's permission to access specific resources, actions, or use services based on the identity.
- Tends to take place AFTER authentication.

#### Accounting

- Refers to tracking and recording a user's activities.
- E.g. access to resources, performed actions, and system usage.

### Multifactor Authentication

Requires at least 2 or more factors for authorisation:

- SOMETHING YOU KNOW. Such as; passwords, PINs and security questions.
- SOMETHING YOU HAVE. Such as; smartphones, smart cards and tokens.
- SOMETHING YOU ARE. Such as; fingerprints, facial features andiris patterns.
- SOMEWHERE YOU ARE. Such as; IP address, GPS and Wi-Fi location.
