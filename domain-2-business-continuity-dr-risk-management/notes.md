### Business Continuity

The purpose is to ensure continuous operations despite disruptions. Doing so helps to minimise financial losses and downtime. As a result it can help to maintain stakeholder confidence and compliance. It allows quick recovery from incidents.

#### Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

There are a number of components that make up a business continuity plan:

**1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA):**

- Identifies critical business functions and the impact of disruptions.
- Prioritises recovery efforts based on risk and importance.

**2. Recovery Strategies:**

- Defines how to restore critical operations (e.g. backup systems, alternate sites)

**3. Crisis Management Plan:**

- Outlines roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols during a disruption.

**4. Training and Awareness:**

- Ensures employees understand their roles in the BC plan.

**5. Testing and Maintenance:**

- Regularly tests the plan to ensure effectiveness and updates it as needed.
