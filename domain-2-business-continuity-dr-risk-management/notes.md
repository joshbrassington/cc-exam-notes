### Business Continuity

The purpose is to ensure continuous operations despite disruptions. Doing so helps to minimise financial losses and downtime. As a result it can help to maintain stakeholder confidence and compliance. It allows quick recovery from incidents.

#### Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

There are a number of components that make up a business continuity plan:

**1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA):**

- Identifies critical business functions and the impact of disruptions.
- Prioritises recovery efforts based on risk and importance.

**2. Recovery Strategies:**

- Defines how to restore critical operations (e.g. backup systems, alternate sites)

**3. Crisis Management Plan:**

- Outlines roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols during a disruption.

**4. Training and Awareness:**

- Ensures employees understand their roles in the BC plan.

**5. Testing and Maintenance:**

- Regularly tests the plan to ensure effectiveness and updates it as needed.

### Disaster Recovery

The purpose of this is to minimise downtime and ensure a rapid system recovery. It's used to restore critical IT operations after an incident so that the integrity of data can be protected and prevented from loss. Disaster recovery also helps to support compliance. There are many regulations which **REQUIRE** organisations to have DR plans in place to protect sensitive data.

#### Components of Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):

**1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**

**2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**

**3. Backup and Recovery Strategies:**

- These are methods for backing up and restoring data.
- E.g. cloud backups, off-site storage)
- 
**4. Disaster Recovery Sites:**
  
- These are alternate locations for restoring IT operations.
- E.g. hot sites, warm sites, cold sites)
- 
**5. Testing and Drills:**
  
- Regluar testing of the DR plan to ensure effectiveness.
